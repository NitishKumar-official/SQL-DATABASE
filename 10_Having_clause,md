=>similar to where clause, i.e. applies some condition on rows But it is used when we want to apply
  any condition after grouping.

=> Where is for the table, Having is for a GROUP
=> grouping is necessary for Having  

SELECT age, max(followers)
FROM user
GROUP BY age
HAVING max(followers)>200;

//sabse pahle age ke hisab se grouping hoga uske baad us sara grouping me sabka max wala user show hoga 
  lekin jab Having ka condition apply hoga tb usme se bhi jis jis followers 200 se jyada hoga sare GROUP me\
  wahi show hoga.
